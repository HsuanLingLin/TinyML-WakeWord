# TinyML-WakeWord
An embedded application that can recognize the words "UP" and "DOWN". Let's sing "We live it up down up downðŸŽµ" to activate the LED light.
Goal
Since I am curious about how digital assistants work, such as Google Assistant, Apple's Siri, and Amazon Alexa, I choose Wake-Word detection as my TinyML project. 
In this way, I could understand why my iPhone can always magically detect "Hey Siri." 
My goal is to train a new model that can recognize "UP" and "DOWN," I will apply it to my Arduino device. 
Then, when I say "UP," the device can turn on the green light;
when I say "DOWN," the device can turn on the red light, and if I say other words, it can turn on the blue light. 
The most amazing part is that I can just use this little embedded device combined 
with Tensorflow lite so that my device can run machine learning that detects the words I say.
